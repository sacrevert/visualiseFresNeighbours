# visualiseFresNeighbours
Quick tool for visualising neighbourhoods used in Frescalo (https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00146.x)

This tool can be seen in action here: https://olipes.shinyapps.io/visualiseFresNeighbours

British neighbourhoods were created using the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2020 (10 m resolution), combined with information on calcareous and peaty soils. Irish neighbourhoods were created using the Corine Land Cover Map 2018 (100 m resolution), combined with information on calcareous and peaty soils. Site-to-site environmental similarity matrices were calculated using the cosine approach.
